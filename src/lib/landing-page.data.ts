export const FAQS = [
    {
        q: "What was the inspiration for this app?",
        answer: `The biggest inspiration definitely came from our own frustrations of the available productivity apps in the market.
<br>
<br>
We found that existing solutions were overly complicated, visually unappealing, cumbersome, sluggish in performance, or lacked essential customization options. 
<br>
<br>
We also identified a gap in the market for a unified solution that captures what makes bullet journaling so appealing—a canvas for introspection and life design that effortlessly weaves productivity trackers in just a few pages.
<br>
<br>
So, we built Oakspace—which essentially became this labor of love that is at once a melange of our favorite productivity tools and a result of our best efforts in translating the experience of bullet journaling into the digital space.
<br>
<br>
We are proud of this current iteration, but rest assured that it won't be the last as we have plenty of cool features planned for the future.
`
    },
    {
        q: "Is there a mobile app?",
        answer: `Not currently! 
<br>
<br>
Our goal is to ultimately shape Oakspace into the market's leading productivity app.
<br>
And we believe the a multi-modal approach is core to this vision.
<br>
<br>
We are very much wary of the maxim "out of sight, out of mind," and we recognize that limiting the app to a single platform creates a significant barrier to this vision.
<br>
<br>
So to make user data as visible and actionable as possible, we see a multi-modal approach as essential—ensuring that the app is available across multiple platforms.
<br>
<br>
This is currently our biggest priority. We are putting extra care and effort into making Oakspace available and optimized for mobile since a lot of our frustrations with existing apps–which stem mostly from speed, friction, complexity, & ease of use–are actually mobile apps.
`
    },
    {
        q: "How does this compare to Notion?",
        answer: `Among existing tools, Notion is the nearest in concept, as it's often used as an all-in-one productivity solution.
<br>
<br>
But it wasn't built specifically for that. Core tracking features & session timers aren't native to Notion.
<br>
So, users often spend hours setting up complex layouts, and databases, formulas, and digging through third-party widgets and paying fortemplates. 
<br>
<br>
These systems often end up feeling cumbersome, bloated, and full of friction.
<br>
Oakspace provides these features natively, so users have a complete, ready-to-go experience from the start.
<br>
<br>
Notion is also notorious for feeling slow and heavy, especially on mobile, as it has to support and respect all types of user content and curated layouts.
Oakspace, on the other hand, is purpose-built for its features and optimized across all platforms.`
    },
    {
        q: "How does this compare to bullet journaling?",
        answer: `Bullet journaling was a major inspiration for Oakspace—both in its product philosophy and aesthetic direction.
<br>
Our designs were greatly informed by the beautiful journal spreads (and Notion home pages) that users have created and shared online.
<br>
<br>
We figured that the best design direction would be to honor the systems people were already creating for themselves. A bird's-eye-view-focused design, customization, and that intimate journal feel became our utmost design priorities. 
<br>
<br>
We understand that it's impossible to emulate the sheer flexibility of a blank journal spread or digitally replicate the analog experience of journaling.
<br>
<br>
We sought instead to focus on capturing the spirit of journaling by removing the overwhelm of filling a blank spread and the burden of keeping multiple journals, while adding the immediacy & convenience of a digital experience.`
