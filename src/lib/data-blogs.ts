"We want to find a home in a walkable neighborhood!" — says the couple ready to put down roots.

Goals are self-prescribed guides to ideal living. So achieving them could be a matter life-affirming fulfillment or uncomfortable stagnation.
<br>
<br>
There are an abundance of things to know about goal attainment; and what often gets gets the spotlight is in the systems that we must build to reach them: the breakdown of larger goals into actionable steps, the habits and routines, and mindset we adopt that push us forward. 
<br>
<br>
But at the start of it all is knowing what to even reach for; what goals are truly worth our attention. Before any system or process is built, we must aim wisely.

Should you set a SMART goal? What goals should have KPRs? Focus on outcomes? Track key metrics?
<br>

Before you even tackle all of that, its important to first understand that goals should be deeply personal. They should be shaped by your values, your curiosity, and the version of yourself you want to grow into.

"Ikigai" is way of thinking that translates to “a reason for being” or a “reason to get up in the morning.” This philopshy can be broken down onto a mental framework that seeks to finds the intersection between what brings you joy, what you're good at, and what aligns with your values and the world's needs.

For example, if you have a passion for learning and a natural inclination toward academia, coupled with a desire to help others, a goal might be to pursue a career in healthcare, where you can both expand your knowledge and make a meaningful impact on people's well-being while getting paid healthily.

And from there new goals arise: getting into a reputable med school, finding a speciality, and gaining hands-on-experience. By zooming out and embracing this mental framework, you can create a solid foundation for setting meaningful goals.

He's the rightful heir to the kingdom of Gondor and carries all the expected traits: strength, mastery in combat, and wise and inspiring leadership. But what makes him truly compelling is the balance he strikes. Alongside his power, he's selfless, a healer, gentle and kind to high lords and commoners alike, and even unafraid sing or recite poetry.
<br>
<br>
One could easily be inspired by the depth and integrity of a man like that. If you're moved by Aragorn's blend of strength, compassion, and artistry, your goals might include not just physical fitness or leadership roles, but also acts of service, creative expression, and the courage to embrace vulnerability.

By looking to those we admire, we can discover the qualities we want to cultivate and the goals that will help us do it.
